Redux and React Router Example App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/knowbody/redux-react-router-example-app.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/knowbody/redux-react-router-example-app)

(Work in progres...)
**The goal:** I decided to start working on this project because I found myself and also some of
others looking for an example of "fully-featured" app.

Feel free to contribute to make it a great start point for others.
